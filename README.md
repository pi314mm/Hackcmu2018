##Inspiration

Our inspiration for the project originated when we noticed the large waste of meal blocks. Specifically, freshmen are required to
purchase a meal plan which often provides more meal blocks than they require. Furthermore,
many upperclassmen purchase food directly from places where these blocks can be used. This is higly inefficient, and we realized that freshmen could sell upperclassmen
these meal blocks. 
We realized the idea of a buyer requesting to purchase a certain item (rather than a seller offering to sell it)
could be applied to a variety of situations, including the food resources at Carnegie Mellon. We then set out to 
create an application which allowed buyers to directly request specific items from sellers.

The website was created using node.js, handlebar html templating, bootstrap, and sql databases. Buyers can create accounts
and submit items that they wish to purchase. Other users can then submit bids to fulfill those orders. 
Items can be sorted into a variety of categories, and information about each item is displayed in an organized table.
